# TODO

Outstanding issues and planned work.

## Priorities

- [ ] Remove duplicate `index-repo.sh` (exists in both `skills/hooks/index-search/` and `skills/development/scripts/` — consolidate to one location)
- [ ] Add an install script (`install.sh`) that automates the full setup from INSTALLATION.md
- [ ] Update README.md skill descriptions when skills are added or changed
